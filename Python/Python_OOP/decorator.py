# Decorator = A function that extends the behaviour of another function
#             w/o modifying the base function
#             pass the base function as an argument to the decorator



# This is the basic structure of a decorator
def add_sprinkles(func): # A function will be passed to the function/decorator before the one it is placed
  # The wrapper is a necessary function
  # If not present, as soon as the decorator is called the commandes
  # inside the decorator will be called
  #def wrapper(): #if we pass the wrapper func without args, it will give type error as base function has args
  # To make sure any number of arguments can be passed we use *args and **kwargs
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    print("*You add sprinkles üéä") # The star means decorator
    func(*args, **kwargs) # Passing arguments to the base function
  return wrapper

def add_fudge(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    print("*You add fudge üç´")
    func(*args, **kwargs)
  return wrapper
